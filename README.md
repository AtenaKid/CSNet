# CSNet
This is reimplemenation of CSNet [1] for block based compressive sensing reconstruction. CSNet is implemented in Matconvnet. 
This implement is motivated by DnCNN implementation [2]


## Current Performance | PSNR (dB)


## Disclaimer 
Due to some parameters are not mentioned in [1], I try my bet to reproduce the resported results, by evaluating several parameter. However, the re-implementation results (PSNR - dB) are still 1~2dB lower than reported results. 

If you find the better configurations, or any suggestion. Feeling free to recommend me.
